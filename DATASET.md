Accuracy and Loss:

The training accuracy starts at 84.74% and improves to 93.74% by the 10th epoch.
Training loss decreases from 0.4669 to 0.2111, indicating improvement in the model's ability to fit the training data.
Validation accuracy and loss also show improvement, suggesting that the model is generalizing well to unseen data.
Training Duration: The duration of each epoch varies, with an average around 170 seconds.
The duration may depend on factors such as the complexity of the model, dataset size, and hardware used for training.
